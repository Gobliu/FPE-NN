Generally, there are two scripts you may need to run. "PxtGenerator" generates pdf data, and "InverseSolver" solves the inverse problem of the Fokker-Planck Equation. Please follow the same format if you need to generate your own data. The "Modules" folder contains class functions used by the main scripts and the "Pxt" folder stores the generated data.

Below are the used libraries in my environment:
python 3.8, NumPy 1.19.2, SciPy 1.5.2, TensorFlow-GPU 2.2.0, Keras 2.4.3, Matplotlib 3.3.2
